# Buy simply, Sell beautifullyâ„¢

A platform to sell your products on a site that actually helps your product
sell. Sites like ebay and craigslist do not make your products look worth buying.

## Style Sheet
Simple and clean are the name of the game. If you can't decide if something should
be added or not, it probably shouldn't be.
